# UASparser â€” A User Agent String parser for PHP

** Important: while the code in this package is functional, it's no longer any use because the data source at user-agent-string.info (now udger.com) it relied on is no longer available.**

It may work with udger.com's commercial data sources, but that's not available to test with; I recommend you switch to a different system such as [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect).
